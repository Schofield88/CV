# Luke Phyall #

Full-stack developer in training, currently studying full-time with Makers Academy in London. From a construction background following 12 years in steelwork as a 3D CAD detailer, with additional stints as a personal trainer, an Operational Support Grade contractor escort in HMP Maidstone, and as a Mobile Plant Operative (line takeoff forklift operator) in the Knauf UK Sittingbourne plaster board plant.

Following university my original sector was UK construction, specifically steel, completely at odds with my degree (BA Geography, University of Southampton). Going in as essentially an apprentice to an engineering discipline meant working daily with real-world technical problems to constant time pressure. In order to save for the Makers course I spent the best part of year working as an MPO in a plaster board factory, doing 12 hour day and night shifts. The nature of working with a continuous line process in a time-pressured environment has left me capable of a high level of graft and robust abilities to cope with high-conflict situations.

I’m constantly making an effort to couple a budding technical ability with a team-spirited alacritous manner, and very much looking forward to a new career as a software professional.

Also looking forward to a working environment with a lot less swearing in it.

## Skills

#### Firm under pressure

- As a steelwork detailer, every project was against an immediate deadline. It was never a case of "Here's what we need, just get it back to us when it's finished". Deadlines were constant and persistent. On top of that, due to the litigious nature of the construction industry clients would regularly be on the phone asking for progress updates. If you had 4 weeks to complete a project, you'd start getting "Is it finished yet?" phone calls after 2. Penalty clauses are a common feature of contracts in construction, so missing deadlines almost always meant some sort of financial penalty.

- As a line takeoff driver in the Knauf UK Sittingbourne plaster board plant, I was driving against a continuous process line. Pallets of plaster board weighing up to two tonnes would need to be lifted from the line takeoff point, stacked with the pallet behind it, then taken into the warehouse for storage. On top of that, the machinery of the line used a number of consumables such as the plastic film used to wrap the pallets, and the wooden bearers that functioned as feet. When these ran out, the line would have to be temporarily paused, the consumable replaced, and the machinery restarted. Failure to stay on top of the consumables could result in the line backing up to the point of forcing a shut, which cost the company an estimated £12,000 per event. In addition, pallets damaged during their transit through the line had to be manually reopened, the broken boards extracted and replaced by hand, and the pallet rewrapped. One's approach to the work had to be robust and determined. The pressure stay ahead of the line was constant and unending for the entirety of the 12-hour shift, and would frequently result in extreme friction between members of the shift.

- As a result of these experiences (and while I do not like them) I am no stranger to pressurized, high-stress working conditions. I understand that people up against strict deadlines under a work load that does not seem manageable are not themselves, that cracks can develop in any team no matter how good-natured and personable they usually are, and that a mature and calm approach is really the only way to ensure that a charged situation doesn't start spiralling. I'm also not inclined to panic, because the only thing panic does reliably is cloud judgement.

#### Attention to detail

- Engineering drawings are often not specifically drawn for steel. They will show a level on a building or frame, together with any concrete, blockwork, foundations, services, heights above ground, cladding and roofing systems, existing structures, plus anything else that might need to be included for reference. To produce separate drawings for each of these would result in an administrative nightmare, as the standard size for a UK general arrangement drawing is A1. As such, complex and densely-drawn GAs have to be scrutinised for whatever information you needed. On top of that, UK steel sections are grouped by nominal size and differentiated by weight per metre; there is a difference between a 305x305x97 UC and a 305x305x118 UC, and a considerable difference between those and a 305x165x54 UB. These differences cannot be missed as a steel frame is designed by an engineer to resist specific loads and moment forces; in addition, levels to top of steel can vary between adjacent beams to suit floor level requirements.

- Failure to register and include the considerable amount of information furnished on engineering drawings can and does result in financial penalties for the offending party. One of the things I learned immediately after starting as a detailer following university was that reference drawings have to be checked, rechecked and checked again, and that checking those drawings was often a protracted task. It was also the case that you were frequently required to check colleague's work as an additional safeguard, usually on jobs that you were not personally involved with. Given the extremely precise nature of code syntax where there can be the world of difference between a colon and a semi-colon, the ability to scrutinise seemingly-identical pieces of information has transferred well.
