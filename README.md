## Background

Full-stack developer, trained at Makers Academy in London, with a particular interest in front end and (very recently) iOS development in Swift. Despite thinking at the start of my training I was going to gravitate to back-end, my views completely changed with exposure to React. I'm currently concentrating my efforts on bringing this up to speed as fast as I can.

I came to software accidentally after being tasked with macro development in my previous incarnation as a steelwork detailer, even though I had no clue at the time that that's what I was doing. That was made additionally more fun because the in-house interface was partially in German. I've also been a personal trainer, an Operational Support Grade in HMP Maidstone, and a line-takeoff forklift driver in a plaster board plant.

Doing my very best to couple a budding technical ability with a team-spirited [alacritous manner](https://medium.com/shoreditch-warlock/how-to-be-a-steely-eyed-code-jack-with-steely-eyes-of-steel-dd369e3f6299), and very much looking forward to a new career as a software professional.

Also looking forward to a working environment with a lot less swearing in it.

## Projects
| Title | Description | Technologies Used | Test Suites/Frameworks |
|--|--|--|--|
| [LAMABaby](https://github.com/Schofield88/LAMAbaby) | Our final team project at Makers Academy. This is an assistant app for carers or baby-sitters that provides scheduling information for the child, plus an AR component that helps you when you're trying to find something round the house. As an iOS app this was written in Swift, a language not covered on the course | Swift, ARKit 2 | XCTest |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Schofield88/acebook-Team_404) | A Facebook clone (of sorts) that served as an introduction to software engineering in an Agile team. This was the first time anyone on the team had dealt with Rails, having only previously worked in Sinatra | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, Travis CI, Heroku, Devise | RSpec, Capybara |


## Personal Qualities

#### Firm under pressure

- Following stints in the construction industry as a steelwork detailer and as a line take-off driver in a continuous process plasterboard plant, I am no stranger to high-stress working conditions. I understand that people up against time-sensitive deadlines are not themselves, and that a mature and calm approach is the only way to ensure that a charged situation doesn't start spiralling.

#### Attention to detail

- When I worked in construction, our work flow involved scrutinizing engineering drawings for the information necessary to detail the steel. These drawings were complex, often showing several layers on one sheet. An error at this stage would translate to financial penalties if the faulty work made it on to site. This skill has translated well to software, where seemingly minor syntactical mistakes can break an entire code base.

#### Strong Team Focus

- Whilst I have worked individually for most of my career, my preference has always been for work in small, highly-motivated teams. I thoroughly enjoy Agile and am a very strong advocate for pair programming.

#### Zero Fear of Public Speaking

- Although I haven't done it in years, dancing was a major pastime back in my mid twenties. I was an assistant instructor of sorts for one of the styles I did (Ceroc), and would have to lead revision classes for beginners on a three-week rotation. Because of that, I know how to hold a room and can deliver presentations and addresses in an articulate fashion.

## Personal Interests

#### Air rifle shooting

- I'm a member of Iden Ferns HFT club in East Sussex. If you're rat-shaped, made of metal, sprayed yellow and standing up within 45 yards, you're for it.

#### Dancing

- It's been a while, but it's still in there. Ceroc, and Ballroom and Latin. Cannot stand Latin though; Ballroom is where my heart is, specifically the Waltz and the Quickstep. Did you know that, when the Waltz first entered the public scene, it was considered utter filth? A man and a woman, dancing, in contact, where people can see? The very idea.

#### Motorcycles

- Not got one at the moment because they really need to be kept in garage, but they're fantastic. It's as close to riding a broomstick as any of us is ever going to get.
