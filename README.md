Full-stack developer in training, currently studying full-time with Makers Academy in London. From a construction background following 12 years as a steelwork detailer, with additional stints as a personal trainer, an Operational Support Grade in HMP Maidstone, and a Mobile Plant Operative (line takeoff forklift operator) in a plaster board plant.

Iâ€™m constantly making an effort to couple a budding technical ability with a [team-spirited, alacritous manner](https://medium.com/shoreditch-warlock/how-to-be-a-steely-eyed-code-jack-with-steely-eyes-of-steel-dd369e3f6299), and very much looking forward to a new career as a software professional.

Also looking forward to a working environment with a lot less swearing in it.

## Skills

#### Firm under pressure

- Following stints in the construction industry as a steework detailer and as a line take-off driver in a continuous process plasterboard plant, I am no stranger to high-stress working conditions. I understand that people up against time-sensitive deadlines are not themselves, and that a mature and calm approach is the only way to ensure that a charged situation doesn't start spiralling.

#### Attention to detail

- When I worked in construction, our work flow involved scrutinizing engineering drawings for the information necessary to detail the steel. These drawings were complex, often showing several layers on one sheet. An error at this stage would translate to financial penalties if the faulty work made it on to site. This skill has translated well to software, where seemingly minor syntactical mistakes can break an entire code base.

#### Strong Team Focus

- Whilst I have worked individually for most of my career, my preference has always been for work in small, highly-motivated teams. I thoroughly enjoy Agile and am a very strong advocate for pair programming.

## Personal Interests

#### Air rifle shooting

- I'm a member of Iden Ferns HFT club in East Sussex, which shoots a discipline called Hunter Field Target. Falling plate targets are set out on a course that one walks round. Points are awarded for knocking a target over by striking a kill zone (anything from 40 to 15mm in diameter, for a score of 2), "plating" a target (striking the faceplate of the target but not the kill, for 1), with a complete miss being scored a 0 ("doughnut", colloquially). A total score for the round is accumulated much like golf. An air rifle not considered a Section 1 firearm (generating less that 12 ft/lb of energy at the muzzle) will only throw a pellet roughly 45 yards reliably, with a 100mm difference in pellet trajectory. The targets on a course are set out at an unknown distance, forcing the marksman to guess the range. Misestimating the range will result in missing the kill zone.
