## Background

Full-stack junior developer, trained at Makers Academy in London, currently leaning in a rather lopsided way towards front-end. This doesn't mean it's my only focus, however; more than anything, I just want to work in software, and in the end whatever role I move into will get the very best of me.



Before software I've been paid to shout at people until they threw up, made sure tools didn't go missing in a prison, moved metric tonnes of crisps with a forklift, and detailed steel frames that can be seen from close orbit (this is a mild exaggeration).



I came to software accidentally after being tasked with macro development in my previous incarnation as a steelwork detailer. That was made additionally more fun because the in-house interface was partially in German. I don't speak any German, and debugging's bad enough without having to run the stack trace through Google Translate first.

## Nutshell

**Back-end:** My main backend language was  (until recently) __RUBY__ , as well as being the primary language I trained in. It was through Ruby that I was taught object-oriented programming and design principles. As my time at Makers Academy progressed, I used __SINATRA__, then __RAILS__ as frameworks for web development. Following the conclusion of the course, I've moved into  __NODE__  and __EXPRESS.JS__ as I pursued a dive into the JavaScript Everywhere paradigm.

**Front-end:** __HTML/CSS__ and  __JAVASCRIPT (ES5)__ were covered at Makers  on the front-end, and I have to admit that I absolutely despised JS after coming to it from Ruby. However, at the end of the course it occurred to me that I did not, in fact, hate it; just that it wasn't as syntactically-undemanding as something like Ruby or Python. With that particular block out of the way, I decided that my JavaScript simply wasn't good enough and made it a priority to revise and explore the language. I began by teaching myself __ES6+__, with a view to moving rapidly into __REACT__. React had been used by a number of other project teams on the course, but I had no clue what it was.

**Mobile:** My final project team at Makers chose to build a mobile iOS app for careers and baby sitters in an unfamiliar house, incorporating an AR element to assist with locating items. This warranted the use of __SWIFT__.

**Testing:** TDD was a heavy course component at Makers than ran through the syllabus; everything written was test-driven. Initially this was via __RSPEC__ for Ruby, adding __CAPYBARA__ for feature testing as we moved into web development. When the course introduced JavaScript the framework was __JASMINE__, before finally using __XCTEST__ for Swift in the final project. Pushing forward after graduation, I began teaching myself __CYPRESS__ and __JEST__ for my JS work.

**Databases:**  __POSTGRESQL__ was taught on the course and was my first exposure to an object-relational database. On the first engineering project team I was on we chose to make use of __DATAMAPPER__, then __ACTIVE RECORD__ with Rails. Post-course I've experimented with __MONGODB__ and __MONGOOSE__.


## Projects
| Title | Description | Technologies Used | Testing Frameworks |
|--|--|--|--|
|[The News](https://github.com/Schofield88/News-Challenge)| Following the completion of my Makers Academy, I spent a lot of time flitting about, addressing smaller areas where I felt I had gaping holes in my knowledge base. This project represents my first major push into integrating everything I've learnt in a single, cohesive full-stack project. As a result, it's a bit of a chimera, serving as a technical demonstration rather than a decent, real-world idea for an app | JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, HTML/CSS, Handlebars | Jest |
|[Pricing API](https://github.com/Schofield88/Pricing-API)| This simple API was my first attempt at building an RESTful API. An Express.js app that serves a single endpoint, returning an "invoice" JSON object in response to a posted customer order | JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js | Jest |
| [LAMABaby](https://github.com/Schofield88/LAMAbaby) | Our final team project at Makers Academy. This is an assistant app for carers or baby-sitters that provides scheduling information for the child, plus an AR component that helps you when you're trying to find something round the house. As an iOS app this was written in Swift, a language not covered on the course | Swift, ARKit 2 | XCTest |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Schofield88/acebook-Team_404) | A Facebook clone (of sorts) that served as an introduction to software engineering in an Agile team. This was the first time anyone on the team had dealt with Rails, having only previously worked in Sinatra | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, Travis CI, Heroku, Devise | RSpec, Capybara |

## Experience

**Ascad Ltd** (August 2002 to December 2008)

*Steelwork Detailer*

This was my first job following university. Detailing is a design discipline in construction that involves turning engineering drawings into a 3D model using CAD packages (Strucad) that then generate fabrication information for the man with the cutting torch (although these days it's technically lasers or gas plasma). The work involved:    

-   **Working with small, cross-discipline design teams**
-   **Addressing extremely aggressive deadlines**  (penalty clauses are severe in construction)
-   **Gathering and collating relevant information for the work, plus pursuing answers to issues that arose**
-   **Detailed knowledge of the design packages we used**
-   **Creative and appropriate solution design**  (as the 3D operator you were often the first member of the design team to actually see a structure as it would appear in the real world)

**Hilden Health Club** (January 2009 to July 2010)   

*Personal Trainer and Gym Instructor*  

Strength and condition has been a personal interest since I was 15, so I decided to enter the field professionally. The role involved:  

-   **Direct client-facing interaction**  (you work one-on-one with individuals, meaning your interpersonal skills had to be developed and your manner professional)
-   **Requirement assessment and goal setting**  (everyone has different bodies and different capabilities; you had to design exercise programs that took them where they wanted to go whilst being mindful of constraints like past injuries and medical conditions)
-   **An inclination to being a self-starter**  (all the skills I learnt, from program design to client assessment and professional demeanour, came as a result of research, trial and error)

**3 Delta Design** (July 2010 to November 2015)

*Steelwork Detailer*

A return to construction that was originally intended to be a short contract at my old firm to support a busy project; the work load remained high following completion, and I was asked to remain on. After rejoining the office changed its detailing package to Bocad. This time, additional job requirements were:  

-   **Rapid retraining and skill acquisition** (the company took on a European package as only the second UK user. Following the two-week training course we were immediately under pressure to maintain the work rate whilst using a totally dissimilar program)
-   **Development work** (the UK engineering sector does not do things the same way as the continent. I was tasked with using the in-house programming interface to develop a suite of UK-specific connection macros for immediate use, with zero prior development experience)

After 12 years in construction I realised that the sector simply was not for me, and I had to acknowledge that the job was just comfortable enough that, unless I jumped, I'd cruise there, mildly-dissatisfied, until I retired. There followed stint in a small mailing and sorting house, involving:

  **AJT Mailing Ltd** (January 2016 to June 2017)

*Machinist*

After 12 years in construction I realised that the sector simply was not for me, and I had to acknowledge that the job was just comfortable enough that, unless I jumped, I'd cruise there, mildly-dissatisfied, until I retired. There followed stint in a small mailing and sorting house, involving:

-   **Graft**  (this was a manual job where I was on my feet and active for 9 hours a day)
-   **Attention to detail**  (the role involved operating the company's enclosing machine on car safety recall campaigns. The right letters and inserts had to go into the right envelops, and there would be multiple dissimilar jobs each day)
-   **Alacrity**  (the work was dull, repetitive, so a positive and mildly Stoic outlook was the only thing that made it survivable)
-   **A forklift**  (this would become relevant later)

**Various Firms** (July 2017 to January 2018)

*Counter Balance Forklift Driver*

Unfortunately the mailing operation experienced a downturn in work, and I had to move on. There followed a number of agency forklift jobs, involving:    

-   **Strong and assertive conflict resolution**  (these were warehouse jobs in a semi-skilled role; issues arose, tempers would flare and occasionally disagreements would escalate)
-   **Adaptability** (this period in my life saw me cyclic through a series of short contract positions, and every warehouse had vastly different procedures)

**HMP Maidstone** (January 2018 to March 2018)

*Operational Support Grade - Contractor Escort*

This was a short and unusual stint inside a local prison. A contractor escort accompanies various external trades as they enter the prison to carry out repair and maintenance work, ensuring that every single tool that came in goes back out:  

-   **Composure under pressure**  (I had to enter the wings on a daily basis to accompany contractors, but without any of the training or personal safety equipment the prison officers had)
-   **Meticulous attention to detail**  (misplacing a tool could and would lead to criminal prosecution, not simply a disciplinary)

**Knauf UK, Sittingbourne** (March 2018 to January 2019)

*Mobile Plant Operative - Line-takeoff operative*

My final role before retraining as a software engineer at Makers Academy. I'd been saving for a year and a half for the course fee, and this was the final stint. The role, as a line takeoff driver on a continuous process plasterboard line, entailed:  

-   **High-stress conditions**  (the line process ran continuously, meaning the work was non-stop, day and night)
-   **Multi-tasking**  (the work involved a number of concomitant tasks, all of which had to be juggled against the constant time pressure of the line)
