Full-stack developer in training, currently studying full-time with Makers Academy in London. From a construction background following 12 years as a steelwork detailer, with additional stints as a personal trainer, an Operational Support Grade contractor escort in HMP Maidstone, and as a Mobile Plant Operative (line takeoff forklift operator) in a plaster board plant.

Iâ€™m constantly making an effort to couple a budding technical ability with a [team-spirited, alacritous manner](https://medium.com/shoreditch-warlock/how-to-be-a-steely-eyed-code-jack-with-steely-eyes-of-steel-dd369e3f6299), and very much looking forward to a new career as a software professional.

Also looking forward to a working environment with a lot less swearing in it.

## Skills

#### Firm under pressure

- As a steelwork detailer, every project was against an immediate deadline. It was never a case of "Here's what we need, just get it back to us when it's finished". Deadlines were constant and persistent. On top of that, due to the litigious nature of the construction industry clients would regularly be on the phone asking for progress updates.

- As a line takeoff driver with Knauf UK, I was driving against a continuous process line. Failure to stay on top of the consumables the line used could result in the product backing up to the point of forcing a shut. In addition, damaged pallets had to be manually reopened, resorted by hand and rewrapped. One's approach to the work had to be robust and determined, and the time pressure would frequently result in friction between members of the shift.

- As a result of these experiences I am no stranger to high-stress working conditions. I understand that people up against strict deadlines under a work load that does not seem manageable are not themselves, and that a mature and calm approach is really the only way to ensure that a charged situation doesn't start spiralling.

#### Attention to detail

- Engineering drawings are not normally drawn specifically for steel. They will show a level on a building or frame, together with any concrete, blockwork, foundations, services, heights above ground, cladding and roofing systems, existing structures, plus anything else that might need to be included for reference. As such, complex and densely-drawn GAs have to be scrutinised for whatever information you needed. In code, things that might seem trivial to a human observer (like an additional space) are very often the difference between code running and raising an expection.

## Personal Interests

#### Air rifle shooting

- I'm a member of Iden Ferns HFT club in East Sussex, which shoots a discipline called Hunter Field Target. Falling plate targets are set out on a course that one walks round. Points are awarded for knocking a target over by striking a kill zone (anything from 40 to 15mm in diameter, for a score of 2), "plating" a target (striking the faceplate of the target but not the kill, for 1), with a complete miss being scored a 0 ("doughnut", colloquially). A total score for the round is accumulated much like golf. An air rifle not considered a Section 1 firearm (generating less that 12 ft/lb of energy at the muzzle) will only throw a pellet roughly 45 yards reliably, with a 100mm difference in pellet trajectory. The targets on a course are set out at an unknown distance, forcing the marksman to guess the range. Misestimating the range will result in missing the kill zone.
